## *Plague Village* Intro/Arrival Scene Prototype
This is a prototype for the Intro/Arrival Scene for our Plague Village game. It is **not meant to be functional or interactive yet**; rather, it is a **starting point** for us to begin collaborating on the **frontend code** and **layouts for our scenes**.

### Story for Intro/Arrival Scene
See `intro-arrival-story-script.md` in this folder.

### How to Use These Files
- **Download** all the files into one folder.
- In File Explorer or macOS Finder, click **index.html** which will open the game in your browser. If the game is too big or small, make sure to zoom in or out enough for the game to fit your screen.
- In your **code editor**, look through the html, css, and js files to learn more about the code.
- Feel free to **experiment** with code changes, swapping assets, etc.!
- Read the included `intro-arrival-story-script.md` folder included to read the full script with Player Choices and dialogue. Remember, the scripts for our scenes may change as we develop our scenes further! This is just our starting point for now.
- **Do not change this 'Plague Village Prototype' file** on the GitHub repository. This file should stay the same so we have a basic starting point reference.
- However, if you make changes that you like, **post your folder with all its files inside as its own subfolder under the 'Layouts' folder on GitHub**. This way, we will be able to easily see what everyone is working on.

Remember to **have fun and be creative**! We should be able to experiment with different asset combinations, layouts, and styles until we find layouts that everyone likes.
